A blog series where I talk about the various components of the Linux Kernel in detail, taking inspiration from the book <b>"Linux Kernel Development"</b> written by <b>Robert Love</b>.

## Topics Covered until now
- CFS scheduler in the Linux Kernel
- Processes, as they are in the Linux Kernel
- Interrupts: The Clockwork Orchestra of the Linux Kernel

These blogs can also be viewed on my [subdomain](https://puranikvinit.hashnode.dev) on hashnode.dev

Please do drop in issues on this repo and help me improve my journey!
